Answer to Problem 7:

Based on the results of the Mean Standard Error comparison, our p value is roughly calculated around 0.03 each time the program is run. Comparing this p value to our level of significance (0.05), we find that p < 0.05. This tells us to reject the null hypothesis that the election data is not fraudulent, meaning the results of the 2009 Iranian election were fraudulent.



Answer to Problem 8:

Based on the results of the Mean Standard Error comparison, our p value is roughly calculated around 0.4 each time the program is run. Comparing this p value to our level of significance (0.05), we find that p > 0.05. This tells us to accept the null hypothesis that the election data is not fraudulent.
